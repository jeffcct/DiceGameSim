In this repo, we consider a two-player dice game.
In this game, each player bets on whether they will win.
To play each player rolls both dice, but must make their bet after only seeing one of their own dice.
If the player has a higher sum than the other player, they will win the bet from the other player.
If the player has an equal sum to the other player, no one will gain money.
Finally, if the player has a lower sum, they will lose the bet.

We investigate a simpler version of this game, where the opposing player will always bet and we want to find the best bet
for the first player to play in each case.
